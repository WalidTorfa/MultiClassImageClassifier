this model can be used to classify any set of images you just have to type in the 1. train files directory 2. list of the labels in your dataset then run the main.py to save the model as h5 file

and make sure to mention the labels in your training-set images' names

any false prediction you might face while predicting is due to the ImageGenerator limitation.


*you can try the image classifier by loading the predict.py file and it will predict whether "image.jpg" is cat or dog*
